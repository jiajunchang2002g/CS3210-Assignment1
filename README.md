## Project overview

This repository contains a classroom assignment that implements GPU-accelerated substring (DNA signature) matching using CUDA. The goal is to match a set of viral signature sequences against large DNA sample sequences efficiently by offloading work to the GPU and comparing to a CPU baseline.

## Motivation

- DNA sequence databases are large; naive CPU search can be slow.
- GPUs can accelerate massive, data-parallel workloads such as substring searching.
- The assignment explores memory layout, GPU kernel design, and trade-offs between CPU and GPU approaches.

## Features

- Utilities to generate synthetic DNA sample sequences (`gen_sample.cc`).
- Utilities to generate signature lists (`gen_sig.cc`).
- Shared code and types in `common.cc` / `common.h` and `device_seq_t.h`.
- CUDA kernel skeleton in `kernel_skeleton.cu` for GPU matching.
- Scripts and folders for benchmarking on different hardware (`bench-a100`, `bench-h100`).
- Download helper for FASTA files (`download_fasta.sh`).

## Repository layout

Top-level files and directories (important ones):

- `gen_sample.cc`         — sample DNA generator (synthetic datasets)
- `gen_sig.cc`            — signature (viral substring) generator
- `common.cc`, `common.h` — shared helpers and CPU reference implementation
- `device_seq_t.h`        — device/host sequence types and helpers
- `kernel_skeleton.cu`    — CUDA kernel(s) for GPU matching (entry point / skeleton)
- `download_fasta.sh`     — script to download real FASTA data (optional)
- `Makefile`              — build rules (project-dependent; see below)
- `bench-a100/`, `bench-h100/` — benchmark data / scripts for specific GPUs
- `kseq/`                 — lightweight FASTA parser / utilities used in project

If you need a full file map, run `ls -la` in the repository root; the Makefile lists build targets.

## Prerequisites

- Linux (this repo was developed/tested on Linux).
- GNU Make and a C++ compiler (g++).
- CUDA toolkit (nvcc) and a CUDA-capable GPU for the GPU implementation.
- Optional: `python3`, `awk`, or other tools to help parse outputs for benchmarking.

Notes / assumptions:

- I assume the provided `Makefile` contains sensible targets to build the generators and the CUDA binary. If you prefer to build manually, `nvcc` can compile `kernel_skeleton.cu`.

## Build & run

Typical workflow:

1. Build everything (uses the repository `Makefile`):

```bash
make
```

2. If `make` builds specific binaries, inspect the Makefile or list targets with:

```bash
grep -E '^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+:' Makefile
```

3. Generate data (example):

```bash
# generate synthetic signatures
./gen_sig  # may print usage/options; check `./gen_sig --help` if supported

# generate a synthetic DNA sample
./gen_sample
```

4. Run the GPU kernel (example):

```bash
# The exact name of the GPU executable depends on the Makefile.
# A likely pattern is a kernel binary named `kernel` or `match_gpu`. Inspect outputs after `make`.
./kernel sample.fasta sigs.txt
```

If your Makefile doesn't produce the expected binary names, build the CUDA file manually (example):

```bash
# compile a simple CUDA binary (adjust flags as needed)
nvcc -O3 kernel_skeleton.cu common.cc -o kernel -lstdc++
```

## Usage examples

Below are illustrative examples — adapt them to the actual flags your compiled binaries accept.

1) Generate 1M-length synthetic sample and 100 signatures:

```bash
./gen_sample --length 1000000 > sample.fasta
./gen_sig --count 100 > sigs.txt
```

2) Run CPU baseline (if provided):

```bash
./cpu_match sample.fasta sigs.txt  # example; actual binary name may differ
```

3) Run GPU version and measure time (example):

```bash
./kernel sample.fasta sigs.txt
```

Check program output for match counts and timings — the code prints timings for CPU and GPU where implemented.

## Design & implementation notes

- The code separates data generation (`gen_sample`, `gen_sig`), CPU reference implementation (`common.cc`), and GPU implementation (`kernel_skeleton.cu`).
- `device_seq_t.h` contains device-side types and helpers for storing sequences compactly for coalesced memory access.
- The kernel skeleton demonstrates mapping sequence offsets and signatures to threads/blocks to find substring matches in parallel. Typical optimisations to consider:
	- Use shared memory for short signatures to reduce global loads.
	- Coalesce memory reads for samples split across threads.
	- Use bit-packed representations (2 bits per base) to reduce memory footprint.

Edge cases to be aware of:

- Very short signatures (length < warp size) — ensure no out-of-bounds thread reads.
- Overlapping matches — if counting overlapping matches is required, ensure algorithm allows it.
- Large sample inputs that exceed GPU memory — use chunked streaming or process in windows.

## Benchmarking

- The `bench-a100` and `bench-h100` folders contain benchmarking scripts/data collected on particular GPUs (NVIDIA A100 and H100). Use these as templates to run your own benchmarks.
- When benchmarking, run multiple iterations and take median times. Also measure data transfer times (host<->device) separately from kernel execution.

Recommended measurement steps:

1. Warm up the GPU with a dummy kernel invocation.
2. Measure H2D (host->device) transfer time, kernel time, and D2H time separately.
3. Repeat runs (e.g., 5–10) and report median.

## Limitations & future work

- This is an educational assignment and focuses on clarity over production-grade robustness.
- Current limitations that could be improved:
	- Streaming large datasets that don't fit in device memory.
	- More advanced string-match algorithms (Aho–Corasick, suffix arrays) adapted for GPUs.
	- Memory packing and vectorised comparisons for shorter signatures.
